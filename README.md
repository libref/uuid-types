## What it is
This package is a library reference implementation for the UUID contracts I am
working on.

## What it is *not*
A package for generating UUIDs. You are probably looking for something like the 
excellent [ramsey/uuid](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid) package. 

## Status and roadmap
This package is considered pre-alpha. The main goal is to make several value 
objects for quick data validation, and some helper classes to instantiate those.
At the same time I will add unit tests. When it is a useful and minimal package I 
will start extracting interfaces from this and put them in their own repository. 
I might even extract some basic tests and put those in the contracts package too,
but I have not made up my mind about that.

## Why use this?
Currently you probably should not use this. However, if you wish to help me get
this package into shape, feel free to contact me and we will discuss the 
possibilities.
